<p><strong>1. Personal Information</strong></p>
<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bFqulf_9wGPUpVAxjWjykWThMw8NKtX3">
<p style="margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; padding-left: 40px;">My name's Juancho , student number 's3776171' at <span style="font-style: italic;">s3776171@student.rmit.edu.au</span>, and I moved here six years ago from the Philippines to continue my studies. A little known fact about me is that, though reluctant at first, I've been training and competing in Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu for the past 3 years! And in that time, I've won two gold medals and have gained my blue belt, so I'd say it was a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Interest in IT</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">My interest mainly revolves around how information technology is used to address the challenges of a business or an individual, aiming to resolve that issue in the most efficient and effective way possible.&nbsp; It started when I took programming as an elective in Year 9, and from learning just how complex something as simple as a calculator was, I was stunned at the opportunities. So far, I've only experimented with school set programs; basic coding projects and some theory work.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">RMIT has been a university I've long admired. From the reputation it upholds on a global level, to the kinds of ideal graduates it produces, the community is as welcoming as their advertisements claimed. Though family and friends had their own varying views on what would be the "best" university would be for me, I believe I made the right choice with RMIT. Having already made new friends, been consistently intrigued by what my courses have to offe,r and the clubs I'm eager to join, RMIT is gradually becoming a place I can feel at home at.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">I initially arrived expecting more studies centred on coding, but was partly surprised by how much more was going to be dedicated to other aspects, UX design and the exploring the industry to name a few. While I was resistant at first, the confidence and charisma lecturers and tutors brought to their presentations were convincing enough that I was in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ideal Job</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">For the position of a Pipeline Technical Director, I will be expected to manage the pipeline of tasks that allow users to file the outputs of their codes and programs to be used as the inputs of other processes in the Visual Effects scheme of things. What makes this profession appealing is that I will be able to work in the entertainment industry with films and storytelling, yet still satisfy my more technical desires to work on computer programs and code applications, so the goal is dual-purposed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">As listed above, notable technical skills that will be required of me are that I've had three or more years working in the Visual Effects industry, in a similar role to the Pipeline Technical Director; I'm more than competent using the profession's respective software, such as Python, C++, and PySide/PyQt writing interfaces; and, have an understanding of the common "concepts &amp; systems of VFX", and working on DCC apps such as Maya.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Given I have a mostly foundational understanding of IT, I would need to put in greater effort into my studies in order to reach my goal. For instance, I've had some experiences working with Visual Studio software and have recently begun learning basic java functions. I'm familiar with the concepts of designing a project's interface, referring to Nielsen's appropriate design principles where necessary. Moreover, I've experimented with SQL Developer when it comes to organising data into databases in class and outside, though I believe I need more experience before I could commit to professional tasks.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">As my ideal profession demands high levels of experience coding, pipeline management, and programming, I plan to establish the foundational knowledge for each of the necessary applications for the job. This could range from attending specific classes on the subject to researching online tutorials and their examples. Furthermore, I will aim for VFX internships that will help me build my experiences with the software while in the industry. This will hopefully let me organically grow from one job to the other so that by the time I meet the job's requirements, I'm more than ready to commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6.0pt;"><em>Truity. (2019). The Big Five Personality Test. [online] Available at: https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test [Accessed 31 Mar. 2019].</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em>Response to Tests</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">These tests do well to point out some of my most notable attributes, and with relative accuracy as well. I think that the constant between these three tests note that I'm a creative individual who is ambitious to explore ideas and engage in activities I'm unfamiliar with. Though I'm not as outspoken as the Myers-Briggs test would suggest, I believe that it would be something for me to work on. As the test highlights my clearest characterisations, I am pressured to work on my issues, such as my apparent neuroticism. Therefore, these tests are an indication of who I am right now, and whether I should do something about it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Taking these results into account, I may then aim for more creative jobs in the group such as designing our presentation's aesthetics to match our contents. I would also aim for tasks that involve research collating data for our project given my apparent ideal role as an "analyst" from the Myers-Briggs test, but may lean more towards Youtube video essays, podcasts, and online lectures as one of my main sources of content as the Learning Style test revealed I took information best auditorily.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Given this, I would thereby strive for group members with skills and habits that would complement my own to maximise the group's capabilities. Members who could be trusted to organise the data collected and write them into speeches and presentations. It would also be beneficial to have a leader delegating tasks and overseeing each group member's progress each week, ensuring we stay on track and avoid miscommunication with one another.</p>
<p><strong>5. Project Ideas</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em>Overview</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">My project, a Virtual Reality (VR) application system, aims to give its users the ability to customise and redesign their immediate their surroundings without the physical consequences of doing so. By avoiding the hassle of moving furniture then judge, they would be able to plan beforehand, making the whole process more efficient. I plan to open the product to users with both business and home-oriented intentions in mind, providing them the necessary tools to satisfy each their renovating needs. However, I must be wary of any drawbacks and unforeseen consequences that the system could bear and ensure the testing is rigorous and the feedback is recognised.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em>Motivation</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">According to one study done, 40% of participating Australians admitted to feeling " guilty, depressed, or anxious" about their house's clutter (Organized Interiors, 2019). Clearly, a significant number of people feel alienated from their own homes -- a sentiment no one should have to hold. In fact, I would include myself in that grouping, personally knowing how unruly it can be just to live with my own habits and shortcomings. This is why I'd like to offer these people an alternative -- an enticing opportunity to clean their house by planning how to do it beforehand. Research has shown that people found that "Disorganization (not lack of space) causes 80% of household clutter" (Organized Interiors, 2019); therefore, as they too have identified the root of their issues, I believe my VR product will be a relevant and effective solution to help their process.</span></p><p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em>Description</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">The fundamental aim of the product is to assist users in building their ideal room in the most time-efficient way possible. The actual VR experience will involve users putting on the VR set and either signing up or logging into their pre-existing account (through their VR controllers. Having successfully verified their credentials, the user will be presented with the 'main menu', where they will have the options of either proceeding to the main experience, accessing the settings or simply exiting the program. If users decide to access the main program, they will "appear" in a blank, white room. In here, they will be asked to replicate a room of their choosing by taking photos of it as a 360 degree panorama, either through the VR set's built in camera or through their phone's to be uploaded and accessed in their account's cloud storage. Either option will be just as effortless as the other.<br />With the data of the selected room, our system's artificial intelligence (AI) will analyse the images and reconstruct the room from it. If any images are misplaced, users will have the opportunity to move and change them until they choose otherwise. <br />Once users are satisfied with the room, the AI will re-examine the room, this time to distinguish the room's walls from any objects separate from it. It will then render the space into 3D to be manipulated by the user from their seats or moving around the relegated space. From here, they will be able to plan out how they want to fix their rooms with access to other 3D models of furniture from our databases. This will be organised and supplied by partnering with furniture companies such as IKEA, hopefully bolstering our database to be diverse enough.<br />Satisfied with their new choices, users can save their edited rooms to their account's cloud storage where they can access it later or delete it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">To ensure that this mission statement is met, engaging with the VR goggles should made accessible in several ways for users. Different models should be manufactured to target the specific needs of each group. For example, we could have separate models developed for consumer and business specific use. Consumer-specific models could be cheaper with the screen being replaced with a slot for users to insert their phones in, negating the issue of constantly jumping between one's phone the VR's screens when using the program. However, business models would be expected to be installed with the screens to avoid miscommunication between different operating systems and for purpose of keeping everyone on track.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Notably, the VR goggles must meet certain security necessities. As our program will store data entailing our consumers' homes and its rooms, we must guarantee that this data is properly stored against Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDOS) or forms of spyware sneaking into the system. This could be completed through firewalls; logical securities such as passwords, restrictions, and audit trails; as well as physical securities like fingerprint scanners, video surveillance and barred windows.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em>Tools and Technologies</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">The product will bear almost all of the conventional aspects of VR goggles: a display screen, the housing case, the goggles, the head-strap, and the goggles or lenses. I intend for these aspects to be customisable to an extent, capable of addressing the user's needs when required. For example, the goggles' strap must be adjustable to accommodate for differing head sizes and overall comfortability, the display screen should be capable of changing brightness depending on the user's request, and the goggles must come equipped with cushions for long hours of usage.<br />Software could range from the employment of a simple yet functional operating system for the program and electronic display. A network connection will also be needed to connect the user's VR device and phone to the cloud storage to access their data via login.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em>Skills Required</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Consumers will be expected to be familiar with using a VR device; though, in the situation in which they aren't, a step-by-step help manual is provided in the package. Youtube tutorials will also be made available to consumers. Software such as the aforementioned ones will need to be planned, coded, and tested for feedback prior to any consumer involvement. A team will have to be set up to work on said code as well as test groups to give relevant criticisms for the program's designs and functionality. Applicants for the development team will undergo a rigorous interviewing process to ensure they have the skills necessary to realising the project. Additionally, we will need to outsource our production of the actual VR goggles to another business, preferably one which will offer the lowest price with the best results in durability and longevity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><em>Outcome</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">To conclude, I would consider our company's key performance indicators when noting our success. A significantly low number of customer feedback would be an important one to indicate our overall customer's satisfaction with the product. Maintaining a large portion of the market share in our industry would also reflect our dominance over our competitors as consumers would favour our product over theirs. Overall, declines in statistics observing homeowners' satisfaction with their products would be a good indicator of whether our product was truly successful. I would expect to continue further developing and selling the product until otherwise.</p>
