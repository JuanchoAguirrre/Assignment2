And in that time, I've won two gold medals and have gained my blue belt.<br />Website for assignment 1:&nbsp;<a href="https://juanchoaguirrre.github.io/Assignment-1-Juancho-s-Profile/Assignment1.html">https://juanchoaguirrre.github.io/Assignment-1-Juancho-s-Profile/Assignment1.html</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was originally born in Sydney but moved to Melbourne at a very early age. I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life overseas living in Australia, Singapore, and Germany. I have some prior experience in I.T as I did a similar course for a year at Swinburne, but didn&rsquo;t really enjoy it, but beyond that I&rsquo;m green like most people here. As for my interests, I have a passion for reading (In particular fantasy novels), Dungeons and Dragons, all sorts of games (with a strong preference for strategy games), and painting miniatures. I am greatly intrigued by I.T as a whole, but mostly in Cybersecurity and Machine learning.</span></p>

<p><b>Team Profile</b></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Juancho:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">After considering each of my team members test results, our group may need to give greater focus on our communication of ideas with one another. As the member with highest level of extraversion, I believe I would have to start the discussions and ensure team members are able to confidently speak about their ideas with the group. Being both a visual and auditory learner, I view that my research will mostly comprise of a combination of videos, articles, and even scholarly journals as well as podcasts and interviews to attain the most varied understanding of my team's project's studies.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>

<li><strong>Jonathan:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">My test results are listed below. I believe my role as &lsquo;the advocate&rsquo; will help balance the group, acting as a mediator for conflicting ideas. Furthermore, by being a visual learner I learn really well when it comes to educational videos and slideshows, which is how a lot of research is conducted these days.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By sharing this information with the group I believe my fellow group members will be more able to understand my respective strengths and weaknesses.</span></strong></li>

<li><strong><strong>Murray:&nbsp;</strong></strong>These are my results for the online tests. I am very introverted which may be of some detriment to group work, but I am also very conscientious and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard-working and will strive to complete all the tasks to the best of my ability.<br />

<li><strong><strong>Marcus:&nbsp;</strong></strong>These results could suggest that I am just an average person who observes and learns visually! This could influence the behaviour of my team, that I would observe and try to think if they are encountering any possible flaws that they have not thought of. Due to my Introvert is scaled highly (75%) I would consider small team, when it comes to forming teams.</li>
